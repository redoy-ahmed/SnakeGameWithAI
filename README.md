# SnakeGameWithAI
A snake game in C++ with multiplayer and computer AI snake using console graphics.

I created this project back in 2009 when I was a fresh in 2nd semester in graduation as semester project for subject Object Oriented Programming using C++. I used simple console graphics using various characters with various colors by `cout<<` identifier.
